[0] Two households, both alike in dignity,
[1] In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
[2] From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
[3] Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
[4] From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
[5] A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
[6] Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
[7] Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
[8] The fearful passage of their death-[9] mark’d love,
[10] And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
[11] Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
[12] Is now the [13] two hours’ traffic of our stage;
[14] The which, if you with patient ears attend,
[15] What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to me[16] nd.
